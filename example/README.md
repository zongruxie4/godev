Minimal and functional Go architecture example with three targets (`appserver`, `edgeworker`, `webclient`) sharing logic through a common package.

## 🧠 Advantages of this Architecture

* **Clarity:** Each `main.go` in `cmd/` represents a distinct binary. The purpose of each part of the project is explicit.
* **Maintainability:** `internal/` holds business logic, `pkg/` contains shared utilities, and `deploy/` handles infrastructure. This separation is clear and scalable.
* **Scalability:** You can add more business modules (e.g., `auth`, `payments`) inside `internal/` without affecting other parts of the application.
* **Self-contained targets:** Each target in `cmd/` is ready for independent compilation and deployment.
* **Go Best Practices:** Uses standard conventions like `cmd/`, `internal/`, and `pkg/`, making the project familiar to experienced Go developers while remaining intuitive for newcomers.
